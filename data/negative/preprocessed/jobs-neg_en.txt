condition bash scripting statement linux academy blog skip main content toggl navigation announcement featur cours login join now condition bash scripting statement novemb anthony linux you use bash for scripting you undoubtedly hav use condition lot for exampl for then construct whil loop the syntax thes condition can seem bit daunting learn and use this tutorial aim help the read understanding condition bash and provid comprehensiv list the possibiliti small amount general shell knowledg assumed difficulty basic medium introduction bash featur lot built-in check and comparison coming quit handy many situation youâv probably seen statement lik the following befor $foo -ge then the condition this exampl essentially command may sound strang but surrounding comparison with squar bracket the sam using the built-in test command lik this test $foo -ge then $foo great then equal the block aft âthenâ executed you always wondered why bash tend use -ge -eq instead itâs becaus this condition typ originat from command wher -ge and -eq are option and thatâs what does essentially checking the exit status command iâll explain that mor detail furth the tutorial ther are built-in check that are mor specific shell what about this one regularfil then the abov condition true the fil âregularfileâ exist and regular fil regular fil mean that itâs not block charact devic directory this way you can mak sur usabl fil exist befor doing something with you can even check fil readabl readablefile] then the abov condition true the fil âreadablefileâ exist and readabl easy isnât the syntax statement short explanation the basic syntax then statement lik this <condition> then <commands> the condition depending its typ surrounded certain bracket you can read about the different typ furth the tutorial you can add command executed when the condition fals using the els keyword and use the elif elseif keyword execut command anoth condition the primary condition fals the els keyword always com last exampl somefil then content=$cat somefil elif somefil then echo âthe fil âsomefileâ exist but not readabl the scriptâ els echo âthe fil âsomefileâ does not existâ short explanation the exampl first check the fil somefil readabl âif somefil read into variabl not check actually exist âelif somefil thatâs true report that exist but isnât readabl was would hav read the content the fil doesnât exist report too the condition elif only executed the condition fals the command belonging els are only executed both condition are fals the basic rul condition when you start writing and using your own condition ther are som rul you should know prevent getting error that are hard trac her follow three important ones always keep spac betwe the bracket and the actual check/comparison the following wonât work [$foo -ge then bash complain about âmissing `]'â always terminat the lin befor putting new keyword lik âthenâ the word then els elif and are shell keyword meaning that they cannot shar the sam lin put betwe the previous statement and the keyword plac the keyword the start new lin bash throw error lik âsyntax error near unexpected tok `fi'â you donât good habit quot string variabl you use them condition becaus otherwis they are likely giv troubl they contain spac and/or newlin quoting mean â$stringvarâ âtuxâ then ther are few cas which you should not quot but they are rar you see one them furth the tutorial also ther are two thing that may useful know you can invert condition putting front exampl regularfil then sur plac the insid the bracket you can combin condition using certain operator for the single-bracket syntax that weâv been using far you can use â-aâ for and and â-oâ for exampl $foo -ge $foo -lt then the abov condition return true $foo contain integ great than equal and less than you can read mor about thes combining expression the respectiv condition syntax and one mor basic thing donât forget that condition can used oth statement lik whil and until outsid the scop this tutorial explain thos but you can read about them the bash guid for beginn anyway iâv only shown you condition betwe singl bracket far ther are mor syntax howev you read the next section different condition syntax bash featur different syntax for condition list the three them single-bracket syntax this the condition syntax you hav already seen the previous paragraph itâs the old supported syntax support three typ condition file-based condition allows different kind check fil exampl symboliclink then the abov condition true the fil âsymboliclinkâ exist and symbolic link for mor file-based condition see the tabl below string-based condition allows check string and comparing string exampl one â$emptystringâ then the abov condition true $emptystring empty string uninitialized variabl exampl two â$stringvar1â âcheeseâ then the abov condition true $stringvar1 contain just the string âcheeseâ for mor string-based condition see the tabl below arithmetic number-based condition allows comparing integ numb exampl $num -lt then the abov condition return true $num less than for mor arithmetic condition see the tabl below double-bracket syntax you may hav encountered condition enclosed doubl squar bracket already which look lik this â$stringvarâ *string* then the double-bracket syntax serv enhanced version the single-bracket syntax mainly has the sam featur but som important differenc with list them her the first differenc can seen the abov exampl when comparing string the double-bracket syntax featur shell globbing this mean that asterisk â*â expand literally anything just you probably know from normal command-lin usag therefor $stringvar contain the phras âstringâ anywh the condition return true oth form shell globbing are allowed too youâd lik match both âstringâ and âstringâ you could use the following syntax â$stringvarâ *[ss]tring* then not that only general shell globbing allowed bash-specific thing lik {14} {foobar} not work also not that the globbing not work you quot the right string this cas you should leav unquoted the second differenc that word splitting prevented therefor you could omit placing quot around string variabl and use condition lik the following without problem $stringvarwithspac foo then nevertheless the quoting string variabl remain good habit recomm just keep doing the third differenc consist not expanding filenam illustrat this differenc using two exampl starting with the old single-bracket situation *sh then the abov condition return true ther one singl fil the working directory that has extension ther are non return fals ther are several fil bash throw error and stop executing the script this becaus *sh expanded the fil the working directory using doubl bracket prevent this *sh then the abov condition return true only ther fil the working directory called â*shâ matt what oth fil exist the asterisk tak literally becaus the double-bracket syntax does not expand filenam the fourth differenc the addition mor generally known combining expression mor specific the operator â&&â and â||â exampl $num -eq â$stringvarâ foo then the abov condition return true $num equal and $stringvar equal âfooâ the and known from the single-bracket syntax supported too not that the and operator has precedenc over the operator meaning that â&&â â-aâ evaluated befor â||â â-oâ the fifth differenc that the double-bracket syntax allows regex patt matching using the â=~â operator see the tabl for mor information double-parenthesis syntax ther anoth syntax for arithmetic number-based condition most likely adopted from the korn shell $num then the abov condition true $num less than equal this syntax may seem mor familiar programm featur all the ânormalâ operator lik â==â â<â and â>=â support the â&&â and â||â combining expression but not the and ones equivalent the built-in let command tabl condition the following tabl list the condition possibiliti for both the single- and the double-bracket syntax sav singl exception the exampl are giv single-bracket syntax but are always compatibl with doubl bracket file-based condition condition true example/explanation

than equal num2 num1 num2 num1 less than num2 num1 num2 num1 less than equal num2 aft this dry information load hereâs bit explanation for thos who want know moreâ¦ diving littl deep said iâd tell mor about the fact that essentially check the exit status command and will the basic rul bash when com condition equal true equal fals thatâs pretty much the opposit many programming languag wher equal fals and mor equal true the reason behind this that shell lik bash deal with program lot unix convention program use exit status for indicating wheth execution went alright error occured succesful execution doesnât requir any explanation need only one exit status ther probl howev useful know what went wrong therefor used for succesful execution and 1-255 indicat what kind error occured the meaning the numb 1-255 diff depending the program returning them anyway execut the block aft then when the command return yes condition are command the phras $foo -ge return exit status and the oth two syntax well therefor thereâs neat trick you can use quickly test condition $foo -ge echo true this exampl âecho trueâ only executed $foo -ge return true why that you might ask itâs becaus bash only evaluat condition when needed when using the and combining expression both condition need true mak the combining expression return true the first condition return fals doesnât matt what the second one return the result fals therefor bash doesnât evaluat the second condition and thatâs the reason why âecho trueâ not executed the exampl this the sam for the operator â||â wher the second condition not evaluated the first one true well much for the diving you want know even mor iâd lik point you the advanced bash-scripting guid and mayb the bash referenc manual conclusion this tutorial youâv been abl mak start understanding the many possibiliti condition bash scripting youâv been abl read about the basic rul writing and using condition
