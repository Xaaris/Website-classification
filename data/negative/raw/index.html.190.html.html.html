    <h1 id="domain_policy">Domain Name Policy</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Paid Mozello subscriptions come with one domain name registration included in the price. Additional domain name registrations or domain name change can be done for extra fee which is shown upon checking the availability of particular domain name.</li>
        <li>Domain name registration is ordered online via Mozello interface.</li>
        <li>We are not a domain registrar for most domain types; we use third party domain companies to buy domain names for our customers. We guarantee that domain names that are bought through us will work with Mozello.</li>
        <li>By ordering a domain name registration, you authorize Mozello to perform domain name registration on your behalf, by entering you into agreement with corresponding domain name registrar or registry.</li>
        <li>By ordering a domain name registration, you accept full responsibility for compliance with any applicable law as well as, if applicable, the registration requirements of ICANN and the respective registrars and registries which shall be considered part of this agreement.</li>
        <li>When we register a domain name on behalf of you, we will use the data that you entered in the order form to specify the domain owner. If you want to specify a different domain owner, you must notify Mozello about this by e-mail and wait for a confirmation before placing an order;</li>

The use of this information is governed by the respective privacy policy of the domain registry. <b>In most cases domain registrant information is added to WHOIS register as required by regulations and is therefore publicly accessible.</b> Domain name registration can not be done without this.
